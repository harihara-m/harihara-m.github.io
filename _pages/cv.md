Projects and Internships
======
Masterâ€™s Project Jan-May 2024
* Guide: Dr. K. R. Arun, School of Mathematics, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, India
* Topic: An asymptotic preserving and energy stable finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler equations with congestion constraint.
  * In this project, we designed and analyzed a finite volume scheme for the barotropic Euler equations with the congestion pressure law and performed the singular limit termed as the hard congestion limit at the discrete level.
  * The developed scheme was an entropy stable and asymptotic preserving. We also obtained a-priori estimates on the relevant unknowns. We lastly, proved the efficiency of the numerical scheme by testing various numerical examples.
