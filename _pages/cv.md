# Summary

I am a first-year PhD student in Applied Mathematics in the Applied Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) Department of the University of Notre Dame, IN, US. I am enthusiastic about learning numerical methods for solving differential equations.

<!--Masterâ€™s Project (<span style="color:cyan">Jan-May 2024</span>)-->
<!---->
<!--- Guide: Dr. K. R. Arun, School of Mathematics, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, India-->
<!--- Topic: An asymptotic preserving and energy stable finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler equations with congestion constraint.-->
<!--  - In this project, we designed and analyzed a finite volume scheme for the barotropic Euler equations with the congestion pressure law and performed the singular limit termed as the hard congestion limit at the discrete level.-->
<!--  - The developed scheme was an entropy stable and asymptotic preserving. We also obtained a-priori estimates on the relevant unknowns. We lastly, proved the efficiency of the numerical scheme by testing various numerical examples.-->
