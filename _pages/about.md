Hi! I'm Harihara Maharna, a first-year Applied Mathematics PhD student in the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) of the University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN, US. I did my master's in mathematics from IISER Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, and my master's project was under the supervision of Dr. K. R. Arun.

I am updating this website now. Please get in touch with me by email - hmaharna@nd.edu.
