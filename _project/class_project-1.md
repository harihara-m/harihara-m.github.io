- **Course**: ACMS 60792 Numerical hemodynamics and Uncertainty Quantifciation
- **Semester**: Spring 2025
- **Instructor**: Dr. Daniele E. Schiavazzi
- **Project Title**: Impact of hemodynamic parameters on rupture risk in abdominal aortic aneurysm: Emphasis on wall shear stress-derived indicators
- Investigated AAA Hemodynamics Through WSS-Derived Metrics: This project focused on analyzing the role of wall shear stress (WSS) and its derived parameters, TAWSS, OSI, ECAP, and RRT, in the progression and rupture risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), enhancing understanding of disturbed blood flow patterns.
- Utilized SimVascular for Computational Modeling: A representative AAA model and a virtually repaired version were studied using SimVascular to compute key hemodynamic metrics, offering insights into how arterial geometry influences shear stress and potential rupture sites.
