- Topic: An asymptotic preserving and energy stable finite volume scheme for the compressible Euler equations with congestion constraint.
  - In this project, we designed and analyzed a finite volume scheme for the barotropic Euler equations with the congestion pressure law and performed the singular limit termed as the hard congestion limit at the discrete level.
  - The developed scheme was an entropy stable and asymptotic preserving. We also obtained a-priori estimates on the relevant unknowns. We lastly, proved the efficiency of the numerical scheme by testing various numerical examples.
