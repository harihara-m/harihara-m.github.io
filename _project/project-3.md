- Topic: Deep Learning for Multiscale Models. 
  - In this project, we designed and analyzed a finite volume scheme for the barotropic Euler equations with the congestion pressure law and performed the singular limit termed as the hard congestion limit at the discrete level.
  - The developed scheme was an entropy stable and asymptotic preserving. We also obtained a-priori estimates on the relevant unknowns. We lastly, proved the efficiency of the numerical scheme by testing various numerical examples.
- Project: Deep Learning for Multiscale Models
  - Architected and implemented an Energetic Variational Deep Neural Network (EVNN) solver in PyTorch to model Cahn-Hilliard phase-separation dynamics.
  - Ensured model stability and physical consistency by enforcing energy conservation laws directly within the neural network architecture, resulting in more robust and reliable simulations.
  - Scaling this EVNN framework to model complex, coupled Cahn–Hilliard–Navier–Stokes systems to improve training stability for high-dimensional fluid dynamics.
